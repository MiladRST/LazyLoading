# LazyLoading
Image lazy loading is a technique used to defer the loading of images on a web page until they become visible to the user. By doing so, the page can load faster, and the user experiences a smoother and quicker interaction.
<br />
One common approach to implementing image lazy loading is to first display a blurred version of the image, and then when the image comes into view, the full image is loaded and replaced. This approach provides the user with a visual placeholder that gives the impression of an image being present, even before it has loaded.

The example is available in <strong>index.html</strong>.
